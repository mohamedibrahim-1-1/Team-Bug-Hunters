## 🎬 Project Name
**Movito (Movie Discovery App)**

---

## 🎯 Project Idea
We are building a **Movie Discovery App** that allows users to:
- Browse **popular movies** in a beautiful grid layout.  
- View **detailed information** about a selected movie (title, synopsis, rating, release date).  
- **Search** for movies by title.  
- Enjoy a **modern UI/UX** powered by **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Design 3**.

## ⚡ Functional Requirements  
The app should allow users to:

- **Browse Popular Movies** → View a grid/list of trending and top-rated movies.  
- **Search Movies** → Find movies by title.  
- **View Movie Details** → See title, synopsis, rating, release date, and poster.  
- **Watch Movie Trailer** → Play official trailers inside the app (YouTube/embedded).  
- **Add to Favorites** → Save movies to a personal favorites list.

## 🗓 Project Plan  

### Week 1: Design & Setup  
- Set up project structure in Android Studio.  
- Configure Gradle dependencies (Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, Coil, Coroutines).  
- Create mock data to design UI without API.  
- Build main screens with Jetpack Compose:  
  - **Home Screen** (movie grid)  
  - **Movie Details Screen**  
- Navigation setup with Navigation-Compose.  

### Week 2: API & Data Layer  
- Integrate **TMDB API** using Retrofit/OkHttp.  
- Implement Repository & Data Models (MVVM/Clean Architecture).  
- Use Coroutines + Flow for asynchronous calls.  
- Replace mock data with real API responses.  
- Handle loading and error states.  

### Week 3: Features & Improvements  
- Add **Search** functionality and optional filters/sorting.  
- Implement pagination (infinite scroll).  
- Enhance UI with **Material3** design and animations.  
- Optional: Cache movies with Room for offline mode.  

### Week 4: Final Touches & Release  
- Unit testing (ViewModel & Repository).  
- UI testing with Compose.  
- Optimize performance (lazy grids, image loading).  
- Add **Splash Screen** & App Icon.  
- Prepare Play Store–ready build.
